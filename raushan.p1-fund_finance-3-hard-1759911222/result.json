That's a good approach to properly identify the investors in our system.\n\nWhen it comes to confirming investor accreditation status, there are specific documents and proof that we typically require according to regulatory requirements. Here's what we generally need:\n\nFor Individual Investors:\n1. Financial statements or tax returns showing income levels that meet the accredited investor thresholds\n2. Bank statements or investment account statements showing net worth (excluding primary residence)\n3. Third-party verification letters from accountants, attorneys, or financial advisors\n4. Brokerage statements showing investment experience\n\nFor Institutional Investors:\n1. Organizational documents (articles of incorporation, partnership agreements, etc.)\n2. Financial statements demonstrating the entity's assets\n3. Investment committee charter or similar documents showing investment authority\n4. Regulatory filings (if applicable, such as Form 13F for investment companies)\n\nAdditional Documentation:\n1. Government-issued photo identification\n2. Proof of address (utility bills, bank statements)\n3. Source of funds documentation\n4. Any relevant professional licenses or certifications\n\nAll documentation must be current (typically within 3 months) and properly verified. Once you have this information, we can properly register these investors in our system and verify their accreditation status according to regulatory requirements.\n\nWould you like me to explain any specific aspect of the accreditation verification process in more detail?"
