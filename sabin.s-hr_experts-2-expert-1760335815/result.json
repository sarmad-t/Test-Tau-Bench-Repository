Keep her as \"hr_manager\" (which was her original role)\n2. Use \"employee\" as a general role\n3. Choose another role that might be more appropriate for her duties\n\nFor an HR Specialist position, the \"hr_manager\" role would be the most appropriate choice from the available options, as it provides the necessary HR system access while being more suitable than a general \"employee\" role.\n\nWould you like me to set her role to \"hr_manager\" which would be the closest match to her HR Specialist position?
