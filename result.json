The system requires a complete reimbursement record with all essential details before it can be approved and marked as paid.\n\nHere's why we need the specific information:\n1. The expense date and amount are required fields when creating a new expense reimbursement record\n2. Each reimbursement must have a unique reimbursement_id which is generated only after the initial record is created\n3. Without these details, we cannot maintain proper financial records and audit trails\n\nTo move forward, we would need to:\n1. Obtain the date the expense was incurred\n2. Obtain the amount of the expense\n3. Then create the reimbursement record\n4. Finally, approve and mark it as paid with your specified date of '2025-07-07'\n\nWould it be possible to check with Michele Bryant or your finance department to obtain these missing details? Alternatively, if this is a placeholder or test entry, we could use sample data to demonstrate the process."
