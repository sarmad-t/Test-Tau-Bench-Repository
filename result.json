Reimbursement ID 120: Meals expense from July 1, 2024 (status: submitted)\n2. Reimbursement ID 121: Equipment expense from August 19, 2024 (status: already paid)\n3. Reimbursement ID 122: Equipment expense from March 1, 2025 (status: approved, not paid)\n4. Reimbursement ID 123: Other expense from April 6, 2024 (status: approved, not paid)\n\nNone of these are explicitly categorized as \"training\" expenses. To properly identify a training reimbursement, we would need to either:\n\n1. Create a new training reimbursement request with the proper details\n2. Check if one of the existing \"equipment\" or \"other\" expenses might actually be for training purposes\n\nWould you like to:\n1. Create a new training reimbursement request for Randy Williams?\n2.

We could mark one of these as paid with your requested payment date (July 7, 2025) while keeping its current classification\n2. We could create a new training reimbursement request specifically for Randy\n3.
